\section{Limitations}

Research is not always perfect, and creative design is hard to do in an objective manner.
This section addresses some limitations, shortcomings and uncertainties of this thesis.

\paragraph{An unufinished instantiation leaves risk in the design}
Because development takes longer time than what is allocated for a master's thesis, a substantial amount the protocol design is left on a theoretical design stage.
Many challenges and constrains appear first when the design is implemented, imposed by the surrounding frameworks, \acrshortpl{API} and tools used to create the software.
Although the author is confident in this thesis' use case evaluation, the results cannot be guaranteed with the utmost certainty before they are all implemented.
Regardless, the overarching design and protocol should still be valid and contribute new knowledge.
Most obstacles encountered from here on, are assumed to be possible to work around with minor changes to the protocol.

\paragraph{Agile development causes a protocol to emerge slowly}
Doing an Agile approach means creating software that works.
It also means postponing work, instead of having a lot of unfinished work in progress.
This is good for delivering working software to customers and users, but not for developing a full and complete protocol specification.
While an agile approach can always back up the validity and usefulness of protocol elements with a working implementation, it may leave unidentified risks for later, contrary to how research aims to tackle risk early.
It can be argued, however, that Design Science Research uses the build-evaluate cycle exactly to produce correct knowledge, instead of drafts and unproven hypotheses.

\paragraph{Lacking contact with stakeholders and Eclipse ecosystem}
The developers of tools like Theia Tree Editor, ecore-glsp, JSON-Forms etc. may have deeper insights and knowledge than the author.
They may be able to suggest better, more pragmatic and effective design solutions.
They can also verify or disprove, or at least indicate, the need for generic tree editors and protocols for \acrshort{EMF}.
The author did not actively communicate with the Eclipse ecosystem, outside of two private chats during EclipseCon 2020.
There has also not been contact with other students of \gls{TDT4250}.
The main reason is that the course is taught in the autumn, while the master thesis is done during the spring semester.
However, the author has been a student of \gls{TDT4250} and talked to other classmates during the semester for their opinion on \acrshort{EMF} and \gls{Eclipse}.

\paragraph{Design Science Research methodologies can cause ad-hoc evaluations}
The literature on Design Science Research says little on how to evaluate.
There are only abstract, high level recommendations to the forms of evaluation, such as action research, case study, simulation and so on.
This can cause a researcher to create an evaluation which is ultimately positive of their view, or disregards important aspects.
The author has attempted to keep the evaluations related to the original research goals, and grounded in existing practice.
Regardless, the weakness of unguided evaluation design is there.
