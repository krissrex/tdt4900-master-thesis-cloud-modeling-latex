\chapter{Discussion}\label{chap:discussion}

% TODO

* Uncertain if the LSP or GLSP has the best approach (many vs few procedures, action handler, message-relaying)

* Some ideas of LSP are not carried on, like "capability querying". Is it needed? Agile says not yet (YAGNI).

* Suggestions to how the protocol should look or be developed.

* Is the method correct?

* Can the evaluation be trusted?

* Is a tree editor the correct thing to build? EMF adoption may be hindered by:
  * Bad or missing documentation+guides+examples
  * Missing genmodel towards web (typescript. cross-ecore tries to address this, but is not stable yet and not configurable with genmodel)
  * Generated Ecore java API is cumbersome, unintuitive, poorly documented, not fluent.
  * Ecore is too oriented towards Eclipse as the runtime, with Eclipse specific Design Patterns (Adapter, ItemProvider etc).

\section{Further Work}

* Develop further to solve: codegen, validation, deployment
* Move the other aspects of MDD to cloud: dsl, 1
* Complete the protocol specification
* Create a fully functional tree editor frontend
*
