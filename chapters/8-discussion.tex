\section{Limitations}
% TODO
* The agile development methodology does not create a protocol quickly. Cannot present a full and finished protocol.
* Design Science is not strict with regards to evaluation.
* Design Science have few concrete guidelines for evaluation.
* Can the evaluation be trusted? How to separate opinion from knowledge?
* Much of the design is not instantiated, so it cannot be fully trusted.
* Not developed with contact with \gls{TDT4250} students (except author).
* Not developed with contact with Eclipse ecosystem.


\section{Further Work}

* Develop further to solve: codegen, validation, deployment
* Move the other aspects of MDD to cloud: dsl, 1
* Complete the protocol specification
* Create a fully functional tree editor frontend
* Uncertain if the LSP or GLSP has the best approach (many vs few procedures, action handler, message-relaying)
* Some ideas of LSP are not carried on, like "capability querying". Is it needed? Agile says not yet (YAGNI).
* Expanding the design for collaborative multi-client editing (ala google docs and Obeo Cloud). 
* Git and versioning integration?
* Theia can be used as a deployment environment by customizing it with Theia extensions

* Is a tree editor the correct thing to build? EMF adoption may be hindered by:
  * Bad or missing documentation+guides+examples
  * Missing genmodel towards web (typescript. cross-ecore tries to address this, but is not stable yet and not configurable with genmodel)
  * Generated Ecore java API is cumbersome, unintuitive, poorly documented, not fluent.
  * Ecore is too oriented towards Eclipse as the runtime, with Eclipse specific Design Patterns (Adapter, ItemProvider etc).
