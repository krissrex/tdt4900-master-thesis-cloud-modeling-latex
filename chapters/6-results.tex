\section{Software Artifact: Tree Editor Extension for Ecore in Visual Studio Code}
* Functioning viewer of any Ecore model in VSCode. Missing most features.
  * List of functional requirements implemented.
  * List of non-functional requirements implemented.
* Reuses java EMF code and EMF.Cloud ModelServer. No re-implementation of EMF logic.

\section{Design Artifact: Architecture for Tree Language Server Systems}
* TLSP architecture. 3-component system (view, extension, server).

\section{Design Artifact: Tree Language Server Protocol}
* TLSP protocol. JSON-RPC based with LSP Base, with a Tree Document Model data structure. Hierarchy schemas for optimistic-view drag-n-drop. Type and id based nodes. 

\section{Open Source Project: Measures Taken for Viability and Maintainability}

* A project that may be viable and further developed.
  * Bundled IDE configuration: recommended extension, build tasks, run configurations. Reduces overhead for new developers.
  * NOT: CI/CD. Easily added later when needed. Overhead for 1-man project.
  * Build-scripts and npm/maven for building.
  * Readme-files for all components and modules.
  * Commonly used programming languages and (official) dependencies
