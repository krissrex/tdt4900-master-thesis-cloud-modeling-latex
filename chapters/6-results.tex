\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}

This chapter will present the outcomes of the development phase.
The artifact's design will be presented from an architectural view, and a functional view.

From an architectural view, the software architecture and the communication protocol are presented.
These are of interest to developers of tree editors and similar kinds of \gls{VSCode} extensions.

From a functional view, the software artifact and its features are presented.
This is of interest for a stakeholder, and someone aiming to do further research on this design.

The results will also present the measures taken for making the \gls{open source} project viable, and something a developer community may want to develop and maintain further.


\section{Design Artifact: Architecture for Tree Language Server Systems}

\input{chapters/6-results/1-architecture.tex}


\section{Software Artifact: Tree Editor Extension for Ecore in Visual Studio Code}
* Functioning viewer of any Ecore model in VSCode. Missing most features.
  * List of functional requirements implemented.
  * List of non-functional requirements implemented.
* Reuses java EMF code and EMF.Cloud ModelServer. No re-implementation of EMF logic.

* TLSP architecture. 3-component system (view, extension, server).

\section{Design Artifact: Tree Language Server Protocol}\label{sec:tlsp}
% TODO

* TLSP protocol. JSON-RPC based with LSP Base, with a Tree Document Model data structure. Hierarchy schemas for optimistic-view drag-n-drop. Type and id based nodes. 

\section{Open Source Project: Measures Taken for Viability and Maintainability}
% TODO

* A project that may be viable and further developed.
  * Bundled IDE configuration: recommended extension, build tasks, run configurations. Reduces overhead for new developers.
  * NOT: CI/CD. Easily added later when needed. Overhead for 1-man project.
  * Build-scripts and npm/maven for building.
  * Readme-files for all components and modules.
  * Commonly used programming languages and (official) dependencies
