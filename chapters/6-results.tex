\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}

This chapter will present the outcomes of the design and development phase.
First, the artifact is presented from a user's point of view, showcasing functionality with screenshots.
Then, the artifact's design will be presented from an architectural view, and the protocol will be presented last.\\

The results will also present the measures taken for making the \gls{open source} project viable, and something a developer community may want to develop and maintain further.\\

Evaluation of the results is presented later, in \cref{chap:evaluation}.
