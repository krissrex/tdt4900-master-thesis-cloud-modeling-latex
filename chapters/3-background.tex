\chapter{Background}\label{chap:background}

This background section will explain some of the concepts, approaches, technologies and software architectures required to understand this thesis.
The findings from the pre-project in \cite{rekstadModelingEnvironmentCloud2020} will also be presented in more detail than the introduction, as the findings are central to this thesis.
Lastly, a section on open source software project management follows, as they shape many of the choices made in the implementation of a solution.

\section{Open Source Software Project Management and Project Viability}
%TODO

* What can make this Open Source software project viable and worth pursuing further? Anecdotal and empirical evidence, not research.
  * This project needs to live on after the delivery of the Thesis.
  * Correct open source licenses, and "license hygiene" wrt. copy-pasting. Eclipse Foundation do thorough license reviews.
  * Use of programming languages accepted by the developer community.
  * Use of automated build systems accepted by the developer community.
  * Testable code to reduce legacy and maintenance burden.
  * Human readable, clean code. Correct use of Design Patterns. Clean separation of concerns.
  * Use of commonly used and recognized dependencies/libraries/frameworks/tools.
  * CI/CD.
  * Good developer documentation. Architecture diagrams. Informative Readme-files with pictures of the running software. Instructions for developer environment setup.
  * Google Design Documents (?). Not too common in this ecosystem, but valuable inside Google. Complements the readme.
  * Publicly available bug/issue tracker and roadmap.
  * Release management. Semantic versioning. Changelogs. More useful for end-users or those using this as a library/dependency.
  * Specific to Eclipse Foundation, is the "Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook" (https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/) and its checklist.
  * Measures to reduce new-developer onboarding and friction.
