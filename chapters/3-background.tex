\chapter{Background}\label{chap:background}

This background section will explain some of the concepts, approaches, technologies and software architectures required to understand this thesis.
The findings from the pre-project in \cite{rekstadModelingEnvironmentCloud2020} will also be presented in more detail than the introduction, as the findings are central to this thesis.
Lastly, a section on open source software project management follows, as they shape many of the choices made in the implementation of a solution.

\section{Conceptual Modeling and Model-Driven Development}\label{sec:conceptual-modeling}

\section{Model-Driven Development at NTNU in the Course TDT4250}\label{sec:tdt4250}
% * TDT4250. Modeling, use of instances to validate model as you develop, validation of models.

\section{Eclipse Modeling Framework Editors for Ecore}\label{sec:emf-editors}

\section{Introduction to Tree Structures}\label{sec:tree-structures}

\section{Master-Detail Tree Editor}\label{sec:master-detail}

\input{chapters/3-background/5-master-detail.tex}


\section{The Eclipse Reflective Ecore Editor}

* Reflective Ecore Editor, its architecture, Commands in .Edit, works on any model.
* Adaptation of editors to special cases like Ecore model and Genmodel.
% TODO: remove? DUplicate of prev. section?

\section{An Overview of EMF:\ Ecore Metamodel, XMI Serialization and GenModel for Code Generation}\label{sec:emf-metamodel}

\input{chapters/3-background/6-emf.tex}


\section{Visual Studio Code's Custom Editor API}\label{sec:vscode-custom-editor}
%TODO
* VSCode Custom Editor API enables any type of graphical editor to be made, not just text.


\section{Language Server Protocol Architecture}\label{sec:lsp}
%TODO
* LSP from VSCode solves language-to-editor m*n combinations. There is already a need to move EMF from Eclipse to VSCode, it might need to move to IntelliJ etc. in the future.
* Monaco general frontend. Also Eclipse uses LSP with JDT? IntelliJ??

\section{JSON-RPC}
%TODO

\section{\Gls{cloud} and \gls{Gitpod}}

\input{chapters/3-background/10-cloud-gitpod.tex}


\section{\acrlong{EMF} in the \Gls{cloud}}
%TODO
* Recent development, EMF.Cloud Model Server, EMF.Cloud EMFJson, GLSP, GLSP Ecore Editor, GLSP Coffee Editor.


\section{Pre-project Results}

\input{chapters/3-background/11-pre-project-findings.tex}


\section{Open Source Software Project Management and Project Viability}

* What can make this Open Source software project viable and worth pursuing further? Anecdotal and empirical evidence, not research.
  * This project needs to live on after the delivery of the Thesis.
  * Correct open source licenses, and "licence hygience" wrt. copy-pasting. Eclipse Foundation do thorough licence reviews.
  * Use of programming languages accepted by the developer community.
  * Use of automated build systems accepted by the developer community.
  * Testable code to reduce legacy and maintenance burden.
  * Human readable, clean code. Correct use of Design Patterns. Clean separation of concerns.
  * Use of commonly used and recognized dependencies/libraries/frameworks/tools.
  * CI/CD.
  * Good developer documentation. Architecture diagrams. Informative Readme-files with pictures of the running software. Instructions for developer environment setup.
  * Google Design Documents (?). Not too common in this ecosystem, but valuable inside Google. Complements the readme.
  * Publicly available bug/issue tracker and roadmap.
  * Release management. Semantic versioning. Changelogs. More useful for end-users or those using this as a library/dependency.
  * Specific to Eclipse Foundation, is the "Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook" (https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/) and its checklist.
  * Measures to reduce new-developer onboarding and friction.
