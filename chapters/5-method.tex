\chapter{Method}\label{chap:method}

The method used will try to achieve the project objectives with correct results, and avoid or lower risks for project failure.


The project is a failure if the results are invalid, or cannot be realized into a real solution, or are so low quality that the project does not receive further development.
The project is also a failure if it does not provide any value for its stakeholders.


The following sections describe the key elements to the method.
There is an overarching approach, called Design Science Research.
It has 6 phases, from problem identification, to development, to evaluation and communication.
There is no methodology given by Design Science Research for executing the development phase.
Therefore, a method for this phase must be crafted from experience and existing practice.
The development phase consists of requirements engineering methods, and software development methods.


\section{Design Science Research}
%* Design Science. Build and evaluate value. Contribute to knowledge base. Is this software we need?
