\chapter{Method}\label{chap:method}

The method used will try to achieve the project objectives with correct results, and avoid or lower risks for project failure.


The project is a failure if the results are invalid, or cannot be realized into a real solution, or are so low quality that the project does not receive further development.
The project is also a failure if it does not provide any value for its stakeholders.


The following sections describe the key elements to the method.
There is an overarching approach, called Design Science Research.
It has 6 phases, from problem identification, to development, to evaluation and communication.
There is no methodology given by Design Science Research for executing the development phase.
Therefore, a method for this phase must be crafted from experience and existing practice.
The development phase consists of requirements engineering methods, and software development methods.


\section{Design Science Research}
%* Design Science. Build and evaluate value. Contribute to knowledge base. Is this software we need?

\input{chapters/5-method/1-design-science.tex}


\section{Requirements Engineering}
% The Design phase

\subsection{Requirements Extraction}

* Requirements engineering by extraction. Skip user testing for requirement validation. Use cases and existing product.

\subsection{Source Code Analysis of Similar Projects}
* Source code inspection of similar projects. Use the same architecture, design patterns, build systems, software dependencies. Ensures familiarity for the ecosystem, and uses already empirically validated designs.

\subsection{Stakeholder Discussion}

* Talks with supervisor. Discovers use cases, features and other wants.

\subsection{Use Cases and Prototyping}

* Creating a prototype or early version and trying to use it will reveal missing requirements. (For example here: copy-paste, keyboard shortcuts etc)

\subsection{Agile Requirements}

* Changes as they are discovered, refined and better understood.
* No big upfront waterfall requirements process. Only small to understand scope.
* Responding to change over following a plan

\section{Development Methodologies}
% The development phase

\subsection{Agile}

* Agile development. Working software over extensive documentation.
* Working software delivered frequently.
* Involve stakeholders
* Simplicity and maximizing work-not-done 
* Regular reflection on how to become more effective

\subsection{Iterative Development}
* Iterative development. Work on one component at the time, up to a minimum level of functionality. Then come back later and add more.


\subsection{Lean and Minimum Viable Product}

* Lean development. Create a minimum viable product and see if it works.

\subsection{Domain Driven Design}

* Domain driven design. Increase software quality, developer understanding and software re-use with layered architecture, domain layer and ubiquitous domain language.

\subsection{Test Driven Development}

* Test driven development, where applicable. Verify behavior of critical logic, to reduce bugs and increase developer confidence and speed.

\subsection{Tracer Bullets}
* Tracer bullets. Reduce risk from integration by connecting all the major components, before developing any component fully.

\subsection{Prototyping}

* Pre-project with prototyping. Reduce risk by testing feasibility early. Creates more learning, validates requirements and discovers new requirements.
