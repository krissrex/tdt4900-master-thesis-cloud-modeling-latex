%How to answer the main research question

% Design Science, build and evaluate.

* Design Science. Build and evaluate value. Contribute to knowledge base. Is this software we need?

* Requirements engineering by extraction. Skip user testing for requirement validation. 

* Source code inspection of similar projects. Use the same architecture, design patterns, build systems, software dependencies. Ensures familiarity for the ecosystem, and uses already empirically validated designs.

* Agile planning. Avoid big upfront design and specification. Change plans as new discoveries become evident.

* Lean development. Create a minimum viable product and see if it works.

* Test driven development, where applicable. Verify behavior of critical logic, to reduce bugs and increase developer confidence and speed.

* Tracer bullets. Reduce risk from integration by connecting all the major components, before developing any component fully.

* Pre-project with prototyping. Reduce risk by testing feasibility early.

* Iterative development. Work on one component at the time, up to a minimum level of functionality. Then come back later and add more.
