\chapter{Method}\label{chap:method}

The method used will try to achieve the project objectives with correct results, and avoid or lower risks for project failure.

\paragraph{Pre-project}
The pre-project that came before this master's thesis, in \cite{rekstadModelingEnvironmentCloud2020}, is regarded as a part of the methodology.
It did the initial steps of problem identification, building, and prototyping a solution.

\paragraph{Software project}
Alongside this thesis, \textbf{a software project} will be created, which is developed by the author as part of the method.
A substantial amount of time is dedicated to this project.

\paragraph{General failure criteria}
The project is a failure if the results are invalid, or cannot be realized into a real solution, or are so low quality that the project does not receive further development.
The project is also a failure if it does not provide any value for its stakeholders.

\paragraph{Method overview}
The following sections describe the key elements to the method.
There is an overarching approach, called Design Science Research.
It has 6 phases, from problem identification, to development, to evaluation and communication.
There is no methodology given by Design Science Research for executing the development phase.
Therefore, a method for this phase must be crafted from experience and existing practice.
The development phase consists of requirements engineering methods, and software development methods.
