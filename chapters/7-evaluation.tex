\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:evaluation}

This chapter uses the Design Science Research methodology's evaluations on the previous chapter's results.
The evaluations investigate how much of the needed functionality is actually supported.
They also present some prescriptive design theories, as design science evaluations are expected to produce knowledge.\\

The first two evaluations look at the tree editor itself, compared to the goal of modeling in the cloud and Objective 1.
The third evaluation investigates the software architecture with regards to Objective 3.
The last evaluation examines the project from an \gls{open source} contributor's point of view, using a checklist with best practices.
This stems from Objective 2.
