\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:evaluation}

% TODO

* Feature test based on Confluence tasks.
  * Result: missing many features still. Not usable in education.

* Protocol-to-usecase parity. (Protocol-to-emfCommands parity?)
  * Result: JSON-RPC part is missing most features still. Not stable and recommended for adoption. The extension needs more features in order to grow the protocol. The data structure is valid; it can represent different tree structures from domains like Ecore, json and file systems.

* Environment end-to-end test in gitpod.
  * Result: the extension can install and render Ecore diagrams.

* Flexibility test to change the label or which properties are shown as children.
  * Result: failed. No such feature yet. No major blocker except development time.

* Editor functionality test.
  * Result: Can view multiple trees and select nodes. Can show/hide children. Does not show correct icon. Missing drag-and-drop, editing, keyboard shortcuts, right click, keyboard navigation, validation.

* Project viability test.
  * Result: has a good kernel. Missing issues and roadmap on github. Clean code, but many TODO/FIXME that are unresolved.
