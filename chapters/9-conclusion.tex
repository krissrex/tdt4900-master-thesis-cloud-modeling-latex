* Identified tree editor as core for editing EMF in pre-project.
* (Objective 1) Developed a design for vscode extension using TLSP to edit EMF models in the cloud.
* TLSP can become the next of the LSP variants, after GLSP.
* The amount of work is substantial, and real value of TLSP comes after adoption in IDEs and other languages.
* (Objective 3) A TLSP architecture eases migration and creates reusable software components.
* (Objective 2) Publishing online is only the beginning of open sourcing, more effort is needed before contributions come.
