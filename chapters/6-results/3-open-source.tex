viable and maintainable as an \gls{open source} project.

\subsection{Code Availability}

* Github, public project.

\subsection{Documentation}
* Readme-files for all components and modules.

\subsection{Automation}
* Build-scripts and npm/maven for building.
* Bundled IDE configuration: recommended extension, build tasks, run configurations. Reduces overhead for new developers.
* NOT: CI/CD. Easily added later when needed. Overhead for 1-man project.

\subsection{Licensing}

* MIT. Not explicit enough in own files and readme. Only in package.json/pom.xml.
* Some copied code from third parties. License included, but not very transparent.

\subsection{Code Style}
* Commonly used programming languages and (official) dependencies

\subsection{Issue Tracking}
* Github issues and Discussions
